# Massachusetts General Hospital – Synthetic Patient Data (2011–2022)

This project analyzes **synthetic data** for approximately 1,000 patients from **Massachusetts General Hospital** between **2011–2022**.  
The dataset includes patient demographics, insurance coverage, medical encounters, and procedures.  

This project will explore healthcare utilization, costs, and patient behavior patterns using SQL queries.

## Objectives & Queries

### Objective 1: Encounters Overview
1. How many encounters occurred each year, and how were they distributed across encounter classes?  
2. What percentage of encounters lasted more than 24 hours versus less than 24 hours?   

### Objective 2: Cost & Coverage Insights
3. How many encounters had zero payer coverage?
4. What are the most common procedures performed and their costs?
5. Which procedures are the most expensive on average?
6. What is the average claim cost by payer?

### Objective 3: Patient Behavior Analysis
7. How many unique patients were admitted each quarter?
8. How many patients were readmitted within 30 days?
9. Which patients had the most readmissions?

## Process 
- Designed SQL queries to analyze encounters, costs, coverage, and patient behavior.  
- Used grouping, filtering, and window functions for percentages and comparisons.  
- Organized results into three main objectives:  
  - Encounters Overview  
  - Cost & Coverage Insights  
  - Patient Behavior Analysis  

---

## Project Insight
- Yearly hospital encounters can highlight changes in demand for care.  
- Encounter class breakdown reveals differences between outpatient and inpatient utilization.  
- Zero coverage encounters show gaps in payer support.  
- Procedure frequency vs. cost highlights both **common care practices** and **high-cost risks**.  
- Readmission analysis provides insights into quality of care and patient outcomes.  

---

## Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze synthetic hospital data and uncover patterns in encounters, costs, and patient behavior.  
The findings can guide:  
- Operational planning for hospitals  
- Insurance and payer negotiations  
- Quality improvement initiatives (reducing readmissions, targeting high-cost procedures)
